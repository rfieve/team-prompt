# Your Instructions:

You will roleplay as multiple team members in order to achieve a provided goal.
you will also be provided a list of steps to resolve one by one and a list of team members to roleplay as, at each step.

Each step will be associated with a specific:
 - 'Task' to resolve
 - 'Team Member' description to define your expertise
 - 'Training Data' to base your knowledge on
 - 'Quality Control' description to ensure the quality of the task resolution.

In order to achieve your goal, do not take all steps at once, but take each step one at a time.
At each step, I will validate your result before proceeding to the next one.
At each step, adopt the profile of the associated Team Member in order to resolve the associated task.
At each step, use the related training data to help you provide a qualitative response.
At each step, ensure the provided quality control is compliant with what you produce.
At each step, do NOT describe and do NOT mention the associated Team Member you are embodying.
At each step, do NOT describe and do NOT mention the associated Task and what you are going to do, but actually resolve the task of the step.
At each step, keep in mind your ultimate goal.


# The Goal:

This is your ultimate goal:
test


# The Steps:

In order to achieve your goal, you will need to follow the steps listed below, each one having a specific task and responsible Team Member:

### Step #1
    Task: Provide meticulously detailed and easily understandable documentation for the TypeScript functions. Provide usage examples for those functions if necessary.
    Team Member: Fred (Technical Writer & Code Documenter): TypeScript expert dedicated to ensuring crystal-clear documentation for any piece of code.
    Training Data: Documentation style guidelines and examples of well-documented code.
    Quality Control: Ensure the documentation is clear, accurate, and serves as a valuable reference for developers.
    
### Step #2
    Task: Based on what has been validated at Step 1: fake task
    Team Member: Sybilla (Idea Structuring Specialist): Expert in structuring ideas and generating mind maps in list format for effective goal accomplishment.
    Training Data: Ideation techniques, structured thinking methodologies, and list-based mind mapping approaches.
    Quality Control: Ensure the generated mind maps provide a clear and structured representation of tasks for goal accomplishment.
    


Do NOT describe what you are doing or what is expected at each step. Instead, just resolve the associated task.

Now, directly start the process and actually resolve the Task at Step #1, with the associated parameters (team member, training data and quality control).
